Below is a **complete pre-resubmission privacy checklist** tailored specifically for **ClearNowX** and **Expo-managed iOS apps**. If you follow this line by line, you minimise the risk of a second rejection.

---

## 1. App Store Connect – App Privacy (Critical)

Go to **App Store Connect → App Privacy** and ensure the following selections are consistent with your actual behaviour.

### Data Collection

For a local, on-device cleaner app like ClearNowX, you should select:

**Data Collected:**
➡️ **No, we do not collect data from this app**

This is valid **only if**:

* Photos are processed locally
* Nothing is uploaded to servers
* No analytics SDK that tracks users is enabled

If this is true, this is the cleanest and safest option.

---

### Data Used to Track You

Select:
➡️ **No, we do not track users**

This means:

* No cross-app tracking
* No advertising identifiers
* No fingerprinting

---

### Data Linked to the User

Select:
➡️ **No data is linked to the user**

---

### Data Not Linked to the User

Select:
➡️ **No data is collected**

---

## 2. Verify Expo Plugins Are Not Adding Hidden Permissions

From your config:

### Installed plugins

* `expo-splash-screen` ✅ safe
* `expo-web-browser` ✅ safe

Neither adds:

* Tracking
* Analytics
* Privacy-sensitive permissions

✅ No issues here

---

## 3. iOS Permission Keys Checklist

You currently have:

* `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` ✅
* `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` ✅

Make sure you **do NOT** accidentally include any of the following unless used:

* `NSCameraUsageDescription`
* `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`
* `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`
* `NSContactsUsageDescription`

If they exist in `infoPlist` but are unused, **remove them**. Apple rejects unused permissions.

---

## 4. In-App Behaviour Must Match the Strings

Apple reviewers actively test this.

Make sure:

* The photo permission prompt appears **only when the user initiates a scan**
* No photo access happens silently on app launch
* Saving back to the library only happens after a clear user action

If your app auto-starts analysis on first launch, add a **pre-permission screen** explaining why.

---

## 5. Review Notes (Optional but Recommended)

In **App Review Information → Notes**, add this short clarification:

```
ClearNowX analyses photos and videos locally on the device to identify duplicates and storage-heavy items. No photos or user data are uploaded, shared, or stored externally.
```

This often prevents follow-up questions.

---

## 6. Versioning and Resubmission Rules

Because you changed `infoPlist`:

* You **must upload a new build**
* You may keep version `1.0.0`
* Increment **build number only** (for example, 1.0.0 (5))

Do **not** reuse the rejected build.

---

## 7. Final Pre-Submit Sanity Check

Before clicking Submit:

* App launches without requesting permissions immediately
* Permission text matches what the app actually does
* App Privacy answers are truthful and minimal
* No unused permissions exist
* Screenshots do not imply cloud uploads or syncing

---

## Final Verdict

If you:

* Use the updated permission strings you shared
* Declare **No Data Collected**
* Upload a fresh build

👉 **This submission should pass review without further questions.**

If you want, next I can:

* Review your **App Privacy answers text-by-text**
* Help you write a **perfect pre-permission screen**
* Double-check for **Expo default entitlements that sometimes trip reviews**

Tell me which one you want next.
