You are right to be cautious here. After a **rejection**, Apple will **not update or reuse the old build**. If you made corrections, the **old TestFlight build does NOT automatically get the updated code or JSON**. You must take explicit action.

Below is the exact, correct path depending on your situation.

---

## Key Rule (Very Important)

**Any change to code, config, or JSON requires a NEW BUILD.**
Apple never updates an existing build in TestFlight.

Old build = old code, old config, old JSON.

---

## What You Must Do After a Rejection

### Step 1. Increment the Build Number (Mandatory)

In Expo, every resubmission must have a new build number.

In `app.json` or `app.config.js`:

```json
{
  "ios": {
    "buildNumber": "5"
  }
}
```

(Increment it, even if version stays the same.)

If you do not do this, Apple will reject silently or ignore the upload.

---

### Step 2. Create a New iOS Build

Run:

```bash
eas build -p ios
```

Wait for:

* Status: **Finished**
* Distribution: **App Store**

This new build is the **only one Apple will review**.

---

### Step 3. Confirm the New Build Appears in App Store Connect

Go to:
**App Store Connect → My Apps → Your App → TestFlight**

You should see:

* A **new build number**
* A **new upload timestamp**

If you only see the old build, stop. The update did not upload correctly.

---

### Step 4. Attach the New Build to the App Version

This is where many people get stuck.

Go to:
**App Store Connect → App Store → iOS App → Version (for example 1.0.0)**

Do ALL of the following:

* Select the **new build** under “Build”
* Re-answer **Export Compliance**
* Re-check **Content Rights**
* Re-check **App Privacy** if prompted

Apple treats this as a fresh submission.

---

### Step 5. Submit for Review Again

Click **Submit for Review**.

Apple will now review the **new build**, not the rejected one.

---

## About Your “Update JSON” Concern (Direct Answer)

> “I am not sure if the old build will have the updated JSON”

**It will NOT.**

* Old build = frozen snapshot
* JSON bundled at build time
* Apple does not patch builds

Only a **new EAS build** includes your corrected JSON.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

* ❌ Editing metadata only, without uploading a new build
* ❌ Reusing the rejected build
* ❌ Forgetting to increment `buildNumber`
* ❌ Assuming Expo OTA updates apply to App Review

OTA updates do **not** affect the App Store review binary.

## Quick Self-Check (Answer Yes or No)

Reply with:

1. Did you increment `ios.buildNumber`?
2. Did you run a new `eas build -p ios`?
3. Do you see a new build number in TestFlight?

If any answer is “no”, that is the blocker.

Once you confirm, I can tell you **exactly** whether you should wait, rebuild, or resubmit immediately.
