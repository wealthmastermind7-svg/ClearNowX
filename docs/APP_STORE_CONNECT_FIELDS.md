## DESCRIPTION (4000 characters max)

### Problem: Your iPhone is full.
You can't install apps. Photos won't backup. iOS needs space. You're stuck deleting things you want to keep.

Standard storage cleaners barely help. They promise megabytes when you need gigabytes. It's frustrating.

### Solution: ClearNowX
ClearNowX finds what's actually taking up your space—and helps you reclaim it fast.

**See What's Eating Your Storage**
Stop guessing. ClearNowX breaks down exactly what's consuming gigabytes on your device:
- Duplicate photos taking up space
- Large video files you forgot about
- Old downloads nobody needs
- Cache and junk files from apps
- Hidden system files wasting space

**Intelligent Analysis, Not Guessing**
Unlike basic cleaners, ClearNowX shows you real data about what's on your device. You see storage amounts for each category—so you know exactly what you're cleaning before you clean it.

**Take Action in Seconds**
Once you see what's wasting space, cleanup is instant. Premium users can clean cache and temporary files with a single tap. That's gigabytes freed in seconds.

**Your Privacy is Protected**
All analysis happens locally on your device. We never access your photos, documents, contacts, or personal files. No data leaves your iPhone. This is local analysis only.

**Premium Subscription Unlocks Full Power**
Free version shows your storage breakdown. Premium adds:
- One-tap cache cleaning
- Large file management
- Duplicate photo detection
- Detailed cleanup recommendations
- Priority support

**Subscription Options**
- Monthly: $9.99/month (includes 7-day free trial)
- Annual: $29.99/year (save 25%!)
- Weekly: $4.99/week

Subscriptions auto-renew unless cancelled in App Store settings. Cancel anytime—your choice.

**Why ClearNowX Works**
You don't need to understand storage tech. ClearNowX shows you the problem in clear categories, then gives you the tools to fix it. It's that simple.

Stop making space. Start reclaiming it.
