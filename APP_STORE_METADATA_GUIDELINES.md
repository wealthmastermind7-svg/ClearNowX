# ClearNowX - App Store Metadata (Updated for Guideline 2.3.2)

## Issue: Guideline 2.3.2 – Metadata does not clearly label paid features

Apple rejected because premium features weren't clearly marked as requiring subscription.

## ⚠️ WORDING TO CHANGE

### Current (Risky):
- "Remove cache and junk"
- "Clean unnecessary files"

### Corrected (Safe):
- "Identify unnecessary files and large items"
- "View files taking up storage"
- "Analyze storage by category"

**Why:** iOS apps cannot actually delete system cache. Apple will flag misleading claims.

## 📸 APP STORE SCREENSHOTS

Update captions on any premium features to include:

### Current (Bad):
"Unlimited scans and advanced management"

### Corrected (Good):
"Unlimited scans and advanced management (Premium subscription required)"
